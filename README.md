# Data Analyst Portfolio Project  
Exploratory Data Analysis of a Big Data Marathon Running Dataset:



### Project Overview ###

This project is a part of my Data Analyst portfolio and focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a large dataset of marathon runners. The goal is to clean and analyze the data, uncover patterns, and visualize insights using Python.

### What the project does ###
- Cleans and preprocesses the dataset
- Compares **average speed of male vs. female athletes**
- Visualizes the **distribution of average speeds**
- Shows the **count of male and female participants** in the **50mi and 50km** race categories

### Tools & Technologies Used ###

- **Python**
- **Pandas**                             (for data manipulation)
- **Seaborn & Matplotlibrary**           (for data visualization)     
- **Jupyter_Notebook**                   (Code editor)


### Key Visualizations ###

- Bar charts comparing    **average speed by gender**
- Distribution plots of   **athlete average speed**
- Count plots for         **participant distribution**  across race lengths and gender
